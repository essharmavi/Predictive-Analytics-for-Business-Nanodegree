<h1>The Business Problem</h1>
Pawdacity is a leading pet store chain in Wyoming with 13 stores throughout the state. This year, Pawdacity would like to expand and open a 14th store. Your manager has asked you to perform an analysis to recommend the city for Pawdacity’s newest store, based on predicted yearly sales.

In the first part, you've already cleaned up the dataset and dealt with outliers.

In this project, you will take this dataset that you cleaned up and use this dataset to train a linear regression model in order to predict sales

Here are the criterias given to you in choosing the right city:

The new store should be located in a new city. That means there should be no existing stores in the new city.
The total sales for the entire competition in the new city should be less than $500,000
The new city where you want to build your new store must have a population over 4,000 people (based upon the 2014 US Census estimate).
The predicted yearly sales must be over $200,000.
The city chosen has the highest predicted sales from the predicted set.
<h2>Steps to Success</h2>
<h3>Step 1: Build a Linear Regression Model</h3>
Analyze the dataset you created in Project 2.1 and look at the distribution of your data. You can create histograms to look at each of your continuous and categorical data to determine the nature of the data you’re working with.

<b>Important:</b> You should have 10 rows of data before you begin modeling the dataset. The correct answers will assume that you removed Gillette from the dataset. If you decided to remove a different outlier in P2.1, you will have to adjust your dataset for this project.

Build a linear regression model to help you predict total sales.

<h3>Step 2: Perform the Analysis</h3>
Use your regression model to calculate predicted sales for all of the cities and use the criteria given to you to make a recommendation.
